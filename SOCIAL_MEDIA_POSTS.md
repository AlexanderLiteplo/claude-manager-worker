### Version 1: Professional & Detailed

I'm excited to share the Claude Manager-Worker System – an autonomous PRD implementation framework that lets you go from requirements to production code while you sleep. 🌙→☀️

Here's what makes it unique:

🤖 **Dual-Claude Architecture**: Worker Claude implements features autonomously while Manager Claude reviews every iteration for quality and generates "skill files" that improve future runs.

📊 **Real-time Monitoring**: Beautiful Next.js dashboard with live progress tracking, logs, and skills viewer.

📈 **Self-Improving**: The system learns from each run, building a knowledge base of patterns specific to your codebase.

**Real Results:**
- 3,500 lines of production-ready code from a single PRD
- 30+ critical bugs fixed autonomously overnight
- Complete payment integration testing suite generated

**Tech Stack:**
- Based on the "Ralph Wiggum technique" (bash loops + Claude Code CLI)
- File-based state management for reliability
- Customizable models (Sonnet/Opus) per role
- Complete audit trail with logs, reviews, and reports

The system runs completely autonomously – write a PRD, start it before bed, wake up to implemented features with quality assurance built-in.

Perfect for:
✅ Solo founders shipping faster
✅ Teams needing consistent code quality
✅ Anyone who wants to 10x their development velocity

### Version 2: More Casual & Results-Focused

I just shipped something wild: an AI system that writes production code while you sleep. 😴→🚀

The Claude Manager-Worker System uses two Claude instances – one coding, one reviewing – to autonomously implement entire features from PRDs.

Last night it:
- Implemented a complete learning feature (3,500 LOC)
- Fixed 30+ bugs I didn't even know existed
- Generated comprehensive testing documentation
- All production-ready, all autonomous

How it works:
1. Write a PRD
2. Run `./scripts/orchestrator.sh start`
3. Go to bed
4. Wake up to implemented code

The wild part? It improves itself. Manager Claude generates "skill files" that teach Worker Claude better patterns for your codebase. It literally gets smarter with each run.

Includes a real-time dashboard to monitor progress (because watching AI code is mesmerizing 📊).

Built for solo founders and small teams who need to ship faster without sacrificing quality.

Open source, ready to use. Link in comments.

## Twitter Threads

### Thread 1: Feature Announcement

**Tweet 1/6:**
I built an AI system that writes production code while you sleep.

Claude Manager-Worker: Two Claude instances working together – one codes, one reviews.

You write a PRD, start it before bed, wake up to production-ready features.

Open source. Free. Wild.

🧵👇

**Tweet 2/6:**
Here's what it actually shipped last night:

✅ 3,500 lines of production code
✅ 9 new screens + 6 components
✅ 10 API endpoints
✅ 30+ bugs fixed
✅ Complete testing docs

All autonomous. All quality-checked.

**Tweet 3/6:**
The architecture:

Worker Claude → implements PRDs in a loop
Manager Claude → reviews code, red-teams, generates "skills"

Skills = patterns that improve future runs

It literally teaches itself your codebase conventions 🤯

**Tweet 4/6:**
Best part? Real-time dashboard.

Watch live as it:
- Implements features
- Runs tests
- Fixes bugs
- Documents everything

Auto-refresh. Dark mode. Multiple instances.

It's mesmerizing.

**Tweet 5/6:**
Built on the "Ralph Wiggum technique":

Simple bash loops + Claude Code CLI + file-based state

"Deterministically bad in an undeterministic world"

But with our Manager/Worker split for quality.

**Tweet 6/6:**
Perfect for:
- Solo founders shipping faster
- Teams wanting consistency
- Anyone who wants to 10x dev velocity

Open source.
Zero config.
Just works.

### Thread 2: Technical Deep Dive

**Tweet 1/5:**
Thread: How I built an autonomous coding system that shipped 3,500 LOC overnight

Using Claude's API, bash loops, and file-based state management

No complex orchestration needed. Just works.

🧵

**Tweet 2/5:**
Architecture is dead simple:

```
while true:
  Worker reads PRD
  Worker implements
  Worker validates
  Manager reviews
  Manager generates skills
done
```

File-based state = reliable
Fresh context each iteration = no context pollution

**Tweet 3/5:**
The Manager/Worker split is key:

Worker focuses on speed (Sonnet)
Manager focuses on quality (Opus)

Skills transfer learning between iterations

Each run makes the next one better

**Tweet 4/5:**
Real results from production use:

✅ Complete features from PRDs
✅ Bug fixes with context
✅ Testing documentation
✅ Code reviews included
✅ Self-improving over time

All autonomous. All overnight.

**Tweet 5/5:**
Open sourced it today.

Includes:
- Full system
- Real-time dashboard
- Example PRDs
- Production examples

### Thread 3: Problem/Solution Format

**Tweet 1/4:**
Problem: Writing code is slow.
Even with Claude, you're still in the loop.

What if Claude could code *and* review itself?

I built exactly that. It shipped 3,500 lines while I slept.

Here's how 🧵

**Tweet 2/4:**
Two Claudes:

Worker = implements features
Manager = reviews quality

Manager generates "skills" that improve Worker

It's like pair programming, but both programmers are AI and they work 24/7

**Tweet 3/4:**
Write a PRD.
Start the system.
Go to bed.
Wake up to:

✅ Implemented features
✅ Code reviews
✅ Tests passing
✅ Documentation
✅ Complete audit trail

All production-ready.

**Tweet 4/4:**
Open sourced today with real-time dashboard

Perfect for:
- Solo founders
- Small teams
- Anyone shipping fast
