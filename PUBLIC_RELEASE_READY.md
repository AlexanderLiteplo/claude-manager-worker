## What You Need to Do

### 1. Create GitHub Repository (5 minutes)
```bash
# On GitHub.com:
# 1. Create new repo: "claude-manager-worker"
# 2. Don't initialize with README (we have one)
# 3. Copy the git remote URL

# Then locally:
cd /Users/alexander/claude-manager-worker
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial release v1.0.0

- Dual-Claude architecture with Manager/Worker split
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- Self-improving skill system
- Complete documentation and examples
- Production-tested on real projects"

git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/claude-manager-worker.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Update Repository Settings
- Description: "Autonomous PRD implementation with Manager/Worker Claude architecture. Write PRDs, go to bed, wake up to production code."
- Topics: `claude`, `ai`, `automation`, `developer-tools`, `ci-cd`, `ralph-wiggum`, `code-generation`
- Enable: Issues, Discussions, Wiki

### 3. Launch on Social Media

**LinkedIn** (Use this):
```
I'm excited to share the Claude Manager-Worker System – an autonomous PRD
implementation framework that lets you go from requirements to production
code while you sleep. 🌙→☀️

Here's what makes it unique:

🤖 Dual-Claude Architecture: Worker Claude implements features autonomously
while Manager Claude reviews every iteration for quality and generates
"skill files" that improve future runs.

📊 Real-time Monitoring: Beautiful Next.js dashboard with live progress
tracking, logs, and skills viewer.

Real Results from Production Use:
✅ 3,500 lines of production code from a single PRD
✅ 30+ critical bugs fixed autonomously overnight
✅ Complete payment integration testing suite

Open source and ready to use.

```

**Twitter** (Thread - copy from SOCIAL_MEDIA_POSTS.md):
Use Thread 1 (Feature Announcement) - it's designed for maximum engagement.

### 4. Community Sharing (Day 1)
- [ ] Hacker News: "Show HN: Claude Manager-Worker – Autonomous coding while you sleep"
- [ ] Reddit r/programming
- [ ] Reddit r/ClaudeAI
- [ ] Dev.to article (optional)
- [ ] Your personal network

## Key Talking Points

Use these everywhere:

1. **"Write a PRD → Go to bed → Wake up to production code"**
2. **3,500 lines of code generated overnight** (real example)
3. **Manager Claude reviews everything** (quality built-in)
4. **Self-improving system** (generates skills)
5. **Beautiful dashboard** (monitoring in real-time)
6. **Open source & free** (just pay Claude API costs)

## Success Metrics to Track

Week 1 goals:
- 100+ GitHub stars
- 10+ meaningful discussions
- 5+ PRDs from community
- Feature requests (shows interest)

## Pro Tips

### For Maximum Impact:
1. **Timing**: Launch Tuesday-Thursday, 9 AM PST (best engagement)
2. **Follow-up**: Post a technical deep dive 24 hours later
3. **Engage**: Respond to every comment in first 48 hours
4. **Share**: Retweet/share user success stories
5. **Document**: Share your process (behind-the-scenes content)

### Content Ideas (Week 1):
- Day 1: Launch announcement
- Day 2: "How I built this" technical thread
- Day 3: Share a cool PRD someone made
- Day 4: Demo video
- Day 5: Metrics update + thank you post

## What Makes This Special

This isn't just another AI coding tool. It's:

1. **Autonomous end-to-end**: Most tools need babysitting
2. **Quality oversight built-in**: Manager Claude prevents bad code
3. **Self-improving**: Gets better with each run
4. **Production-tested**: Real examples from your projects
5. **Beautiful UX**: Dashboard makes AI coding visible
6. **Complete system**: Not just scripts, full infrastructure
